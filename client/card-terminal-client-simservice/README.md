## About the Project

The Card Terminal Client Simulator Service (card-terminal-client-simservice) is a Java-based implementation that
simulates the behavior of a card terminal for testing and development purposes.
It provides a RESTful API to interact with the simulated card terminal,
allowing users to perform various operations such as inserting and removing cards, reading card data, and executing APDU
commands.

### Implementation Status

**Implemented Features:**

- ✅ Virtual card slot management (configurable up to 3000 slots)
- ✅ Multiple card type support: EGK/EHC, HBA/HPC, HPIC, SMC-B
- ✅ XML-based card loading and parsing
- ✅ APDU command transmission and processing
- ✅ PACE (Password Authenticated Connection Establishment) protocol
- ✅ Digital signature functionality with modern algorithms (SHA256+)
- ✅ Certificate extraction and validation
- ✅ Card data extraction (KVNR, IKNR, patient data from EGK cards)
- ✅ SMC-B card information retrieval (Telematik-ID, ProfessionOID)
- ✅ Debug and diagnostic endpoints
- ✅ Signature protocol service
- ✅ Card connection management
- ✅ Cryptographic operations (RSA, ECDSA)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Not Implemented / Limitations:**

- ❌ Physical card reader integration (virtual simulation only)
- ❌ Real smartcard operations (uses XML-based simulated card data)
- ❌ PIN verification workflows (no CHV/PIN handling)
- ❌ Complete ISO 7816 specification compliance
- ❌ Multi-terminal support (single terminal simulation)
- ❌ Real-time card insertion/removal events
- ❌ Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- ❌ Production-grade security for real card data

**Note:** This is a comprehensive simulator service designed for testing and development environments. It provides
extensive card terminal functionality but operates entirely in simulation mode without real hardware interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd card-terminal-client-simservice
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Build without tests (faster)**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -DskipTests
   ```

### Docker Build

Use the provided script to build a Docker image:

```bash
./bin/docker-build.sh
```

## Getting Started

### Starting the Service

**Option 1: Run with Maven**

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Option 2: Run with local profile**

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

**Option 3: Run the JAR file**

```bash
java -jar target/card-terminal-client-simservice-*.jar
```

**Option 4: Use Docker**

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 card-terminal-client-simservice
```

**Option 5: Integrated Setup**
The card-terminal-simservice will automatically be built and started when the rebuild/restart script for the VSDM test
setup is executed. (See the README.md in the root directory of the repository for more information.)

### Verify Installation

Once the server is running:

1. **Check available cards:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/cards
   ```

2. **Access Swagger UI:**
   Open http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui/index.html in your browser to explore and test the API endpoints.

### Quick Test

Test basic functionality by loading a card and checking slot status:

```bash
# Check slot status (should be empty initially)
curl http://localhost:8000/slots/1

# Load sample card data (see src/main/resources/cardimages for examples)
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:8000/slots/1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
  -d @src/main/resources/cardimages/sample-card.xml

# Verify card is loaded
curl http://localhost:8000/slots/1
```

## Configuration

All configuration parameters for the project can be set in the `application.yaml` file located in the
`src/main/resources` directory. Especially, you can set the server port by modifying the `server.port` property.

Specific to the application, you can configure the following properties:

| Name                | Description                                                                 |
|:--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| card.terminal.slots | Number of (virtual) slots that are available by the simulated card terminal |

An example configuration is provided in the `application-local.yaml` file.
To use this configuration, you can specify the `spring.profiles.active=local` property when starting the server.

## Endpoints

The server exposes the following endpoints:

| Name                                 | Description                                                                                                  |
